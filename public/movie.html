 <h2>My top 3 GOATs!</h2>

 <h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
 <p>Being quite the lover of Halloween, and a not so great lover of Christmas. This movie is a good time as the citizens of Halloween town attempt to spookify Christmas. Plus is a  great musical as well</p>

 <h3>Labyrinth</h3>
 <p>Staring one of my favorite musicians, David Bowie, this surreal trip into the land of the goblin king is a wild ride. It uses old school puppetry to bring a lot of the supporting cast alive.</p>

 <h3>The Super Mario Bros Movie (2023)</h3>
 <p>Nintendo's first dip of their toes into making a full scale movie. It was truly a master piece in animation and I would say one of the leading films that have broken the video game movie curse.</p>
